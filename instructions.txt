Instructions on how to setup Sustenance Preferences:
Required:
-A working PostgreSQL server
-A web server (WAMP, LAMP, etc.)
-An internet connection
-A computer with at least a dual-core processor
-1 gigabyte of memory (recommended)

Before using Sustenance Preferences, the files api/include.php and api/create.php must be editted depending on the name of your PostgreSQL server. The values for dbname, user, and password at line 12 of api/create.php and line 11 in api/include.php must be altered.

Drag all of the directories and files onto the web server. Execute api/create.php on the web server to populate the database and then access Sustenance Preferences through index.php.
